# Password Generator Starter Code

Started with my prompts, added a 'while' to check that the password length was correct and if not it would further prompt the user for the correct length of 8-128.

Added confirmation pop ups for each condition among lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols, including an 'if' to check that some character set was chosen, returning to the beginning if this condition was not met.

Attempted several ways to generate random symbols, some of which is saved in a text file in my repository. Initially started with a confirmation check to see what the user had inputted, but had issues getting it to meet the required length.

Settled on checking confirmations and concatenating the arrays of possible options depending on the choices the users made and then making selections from the new array. 

Assigned a value to the password and had the text connect to the html to display the password in the box display of the website.

At the end of my .js is the arrays used for my characters.
